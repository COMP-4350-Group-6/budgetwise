# BudgetWise Front-End React

**BudgetWise** is a personal finance web application that helps users track expenses, manage budgets, and visualize financial insights in one place.  
It provides an intuitive dashboard with spending summaries, goal progress, and transaction management tools, all built for simplicity.

This project is developed for **COMP 4350 â€“ Software Engineering 2** at the **University of Manitoba**.  
It is an educational prototype, not a production financial tool â€” please do not enter real banking or personal data.
