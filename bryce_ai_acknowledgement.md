## Use of AI Tools

I used ChatGPT as a development assistant throughout this project. 

## How I Used ChatGPT

ChatGPT helped me in several ways:

**Code Generation**
When I needed to implement something new, I would ask ChatGPT for code examples or patterns. Sometimes I copied code directly, especially for boilerplate or common patterns. Always reviewing the code and making changes

**Understanding Existing Code**
When I encountered code written by others that I didn't understand, I would ask ChatGPT for explanations. This helped me understand how different parts of the codebase worked, what certain patterns were doing, and how to integrate with existing code.

**Debugging**
I found ChatGPT most useful for debugging. When I encountered errors, I would paste the error message and relevant code into ChatGPT. It helped identify root causes of issues, explain why errors were happening, and suggest potential fixes. 

**My Process**
1. I would identify what I needed to build or fix
2. ChatGPT would provide code examples or suggestions
3. I reviewed the code to understand how it worked
4. I adapted it to fit our project
5. tested to make sure it worked correctly

## My Responsibility

Even when I copied code from ChatGPT, I reviewed it, understood it, and adapted it to our project. I'm responsible for the code that ended up in the project.
