        Load test cases.

    Provide the test report.

    Discuss one bottleneck found.

    State whether you met your non-functional requirements.

        If not, why? Could you meet them with more resources/money?

        Upload .jmx file to GitHub and provide link.

        Include snapshot of results.

## 2. Security Analysis

    Describe your chosen security analysis tool and how you ran it.

    Randomly select 5 detected problems and discuss what you see.

    Required: Handle or mitigate all Critical and High vulnerabilities.

        Attach commit links for these fixes.

    If no critical/high vulnerabilities: Discuss 2 other problems found.

## 3. Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)

    Describe your CI/CD environment.

    Provide clickable link to your pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions workflow, Jenkins pipeline file).

    Provide two snapshots:

        One for CI execution.

        One for CD execution.

## 4. Reflections
Design Changes

    In one paragraph: What would you change about the design of your project now that youâ€™ve been through development?

Project Setup Changes

        Check-ins?

        Process changes?
