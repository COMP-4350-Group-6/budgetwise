# Testing Plan Template

<!--
This document outlines the testing strategy, tools, and quality assurance approach for your project.  
Use this template to guide your Sprint 1 testing documentation and link it in your Sprint 1 Worksheet.
-->

---

## Testing Goals and Scope  
<!--
Explain *what parts of the system* will be tested (backend, frontend, API, etc.) and *why*—clarify the purpose and extent of your testing.
-->

---

## Testing Frameworks and Tools  
<!--
List the frameworks (e.g., Jest, Pytest, Cypress) and tools used for running tests, measuring coverage, or mocking data, and explain *why they were chosen*.
-->

---

## Test Organization and Structure  
<!--
Describe how your tests are arranged in folders or files (e.g., `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`), and how naming conventions help identify test purpose.
-->

---

## Coverage Targets  
<!--
Specify measurable goals (e.g., 100% API method coverage, ≥80% logic class coverage) and link them to your grading or sprint requirements.
-->

---

## Running Tests  
<!--
Include exact commands or scripts for running each type of test and generating coverage reports, so others can easily reproduce your results.  
Example:
```bash
# Run backend tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app tests/

# Run frontend tests
npm run test -- --coverage
```
-->
---

## Reporting and Results  
<!--
Explain where to find test reports (HTML, console, CI output) and how to interpret them.  
Include screenshots or links if applicable (e.g., `/coverage/index.html`).
-->

---

## Test Data and Environment Setup  
<!--
Describe how to prepare the local environment for testing (e.g., database seeding, environment variables, Docker setup).  
Mention any special configuration files required.
-->
---

## Quality Assurance and Exceptions  
<!--
Identify any untested components, justify why they’re excluded, and explain how you maintain overall quality (e.g., through manual tests or code reviews).
-->

---

## Continuous Integration [Once set up]
<!--
Note if your tests run automatically in a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) and how that helps maintain consistency.
