I have made extensive use of AI tools throughout the course of this project. The tools used were:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5 - Anthropic (personal paid subscription)
- ChatGPT 5, 5.1, o3; Claude Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5, Composer 1 - Cursor IDE (personal paid subscription)

These tools were used for brainstorming and ideation, generating code and documentation. I also used these for asking questions and understanding different libraries as to make informed development decisions. Prompts were thorough and well thought out, oftentimes including the phrase "ask any clarifying questions before proceeding" which proved to be quite helpful.
