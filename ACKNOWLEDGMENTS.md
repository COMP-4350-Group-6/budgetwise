**Misc. AI citation:**

It is known that this project is not a novel concept, and that this repo shares similarities with a number of other repositories created the same year. The sudden influx of similar repositories may suggest AI could have played a notable part during the design phase.


## Inspiration for folder structure

root project structure was created with the help of chatgpt

web-next project strucutr was genereated with npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-next-app --framework=next --platform=workers
